## Installation

This application requires Node.JS to be installed. The user should  run ```npm install``` in their terminal to load the Express.js npm package(version 4.16.4) and the uuid npm package (version 9.0.0).The uuid package generates a unique id for each saved note.

## Usage

To begin running the code locally, run the following command in the terminal to invoke the application.

```node server.js```

Either open a browser or navigate to the application via the url above. The landing page displays a button labelled 'Get Started'. The user clicks the button and is then taken to a new page displaying their saved notes. Saved notes are displayed in the left column and can be clicked on to see more details. When the user clicks on the plus sign on the right column, a new blank note appears. Once the users fills out the 'Note Title' and the 'Note Text', an icon appears to allow the user to save the new note.
